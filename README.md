# Intro to Blockchain Technology Smart Contracts

This is a repository for the smart contracts created as part of the teaching resources for the class **Intro to Blockchain Technology (MIS171T / ECE179K)** at the University of Texas at Austin.


Below is an explanation of the contracts in this repo:

## ClassNFT.sol

This contract is an **ERC-721** contract that mints a "Class participation" NFT on Ethereum. The contract only allows the owner (me) to mint nfts, and it is only deployed on the Sepolia test network.

You can view and interact with the deployed contract on etherscan here: [https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xc2b81256a477231cb16af8c72e7648a2900c3dc5](url)
